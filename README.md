# Health Insurance Dashboard  

## Project Overview  
This project involves creating an interactive and visually engaging health insurance dashboard using Tableau. The dashboard provides insights into key metrics and trends within a health insurance dataset, helping to analyze factors influencing insurance charges and customer behavior.  

## Objectives  
- Explore demographic and lifestyle factors affecting insurance charges.  
- Provide actionable insights for better decision-making in health insurance analytics.  
- Enable stakeholders to identify cost-driving factors and customer segmentation opportunities.  

## Features  
1. **Demographics Overview**  
   - Age distribution and its correlation with insurance charges.  
   - Analysis of charges across gender and smoking status.  

2. **Cost Drivers**  
   - Impact of BMI and lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking) on charges.  
   - Relationship between the number of children and insurance costs.  

3. **Segmentation Analysis**  
   - Charges comparison by age groups (age bins).  
   - Gender-specific insights into premium costs.  

4. **Behavioral Insights**  
   - Influence of smoking on charges for different genders.  
   - Family size and dependency impact on cost allocation.  

5. **Interactive Visualizations**  
   - Bar charts, heatmaps, and dynamic filters for exploring relationships between variables.  
   - Region-specific breakdowns of health insurance metrics (if regional data is available).  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.  
- **Dataset**: Health insurance data containing fields like age, gender, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and charges.  

## Expected Outcomes  
- Identify and visualize cost-driving factors in health insurance.  
- Provide data-driven insights for targeted strategies such as wellness programs.  
- Enable deeper understanding of demographic and lifestyle factors influencing pricing models.  

## How to Use the Dashboard  
1. Open the Tableau dashboard file.  
2. Use filters to interact with the visualizations.  
3. Analyze insights across different dimensions like age, gender, smoking status, BMI, and number of children.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Add predictive analytics for estimating insurance charges.  
- Incorporate regional data for geographic analysis.  
- Expand with additional datasets for comparative studies.
